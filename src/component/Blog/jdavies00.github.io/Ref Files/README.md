# Awesome Inc Vanilla HTML, CSS & JavaScript Repo

Use this repo as a starter template for a vanilla HTML, CSS, & JS project

Add your pseudocode to the [pseudocode.md file](https://github.com/bootcamp-students/basic-repo/blob/master/pseudocode.md)

This repo contains:

```raw
.gitignore - This file ignores specific files that are unnecessary to upload to GitHub, such as .DS_Store files
README.md - This is your readme file, useful information to the user always goes here, such as what is in this file. Be sure to add specific details regarding your own project here so anyone who looks at your repo can understand what is being stored inside or how to run the code.
pseudocode.md - This is where your pseudocode will go. Eventually you can put your tasks in a GitHub Project Kanban Board as individual stories. 
index.html - Be sure to keep the index.html file at the top level of the folder, or else GitHub pages will not work properly. Feel free to add more html files here or in a separate folder, as long as the index.html remains at the top level
